We embed a manifest in the client executables to disable DPI scaling.

There are 2 settings to do so:
a) <dpiAware xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2005/WindowsSettings">True/PM</dpiAware>
b) <dpiAwareness xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/SMI/2016/WindowsSettings">PerMonitor</dpiAwareness>
Note that the 2 XML namespaces are actually slightly different.

"dpiAwareness" is only used for Windows 10 v1607 or later and overrides "dpiAware".
Since "dpiAware" is currently enough for every OS CNQ3 currently ships on, we don't use "dpiAwareness" (for now).

"dpiAware" "True/PM" means:
- system DPI aware on Vista, 7 and 8.0
- per-monitor DPI aware on 8.1 and 10

Why only system DPI aware on Vista, 7 and 8.0?
Because they don't support changing DPI scaling on the fly.
You have to log off and log in for the changes to take effect.
