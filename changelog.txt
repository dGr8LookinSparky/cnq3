add: /unset <cvar> to remove a user-created cvar

add: /setempty <cvar> to set a string cvar to an empty string

add: /toggle can now accept a value sequence (2 or more entries) to loop through
  syntax: /toggle <cvar> [<value1> <value2> [value3]..]
  if the cvar's current value is in the sequence and not in the last spot, the next one is used
  otherwise, the first value in the sequence is used

chg: multi-monitor support improvements
  add: /monitorlist will print all detected monitors and the indices to use with r_monitor
  chg: the monitor list now gets updated during video restarts and calls to /monitorlist
  chg: Linux   | r_monitor is a 0-based index and monitors are sorted top-to-bottom, left-to-right
  fix: Windows | the Windows + shift + left/right arrow key shortcuts should be usable now

chg: bundling lightmap tiles into texture atlases for improved rendering performance

chg: faster map loads by limiting the rendering back-end's frame-rate

chg: on Windows, the upper limit of open stdio file handles was raised from 512 to 2048

fix: map download improvements
  add: using numeric addresses as fallbacks in case DNS resolves fail
  chg: made connections non-blocking so the engine won't freeze for long when starting a download
  chg: writing to $(fs_homepath)/baseq3 instead of $(fs_basepath)/baseq3
  fix: only using valid (TCP/stream) addresses from getaddrinfo
  fix: setting send time-outs so the engine can't freeze indefinitely
  fix: creating the destination directory when it doesn't already exist
  fix: the file name suffixes generated by /dlmapf would often repeat due to a constant seed

fix: the last byte of a maximum length bitstream string wasn't parsed ("q3msgboom")

fix: aborting demo playback would crash when the "nextdemo" cvar was set to play a demo

fix: no longer feeding cs commands that came from a previous gamestate to cgame
	example in CPMA: "/map cpm22" -> "/cv map cpm25" -> elevator sound was broken

fix: on Windows, could sometimes click outside the engine's window in raw mouse input mode

fix: when r_msaa was in the range [2, 16], the requested sample count was always 4

fix: /video and /stopvideo fixes
  chg: /video can only be used during demo playback
  fix: broken audio in the output files
  fix: properly named file sequences
  fix: using a better supported video codec (FourCC 0x00000000) for raw BGR output
  fix: broken raw video output when r_width wasn't a multiple of 4
  fix: /stopvideo no longer leaves sound output broken for a while after stopping

12 Feb 18 - 1.50

add: on Windows, "/crashreport:yes" and "/crashreport:no" command-line arguments
  they enable the crash handler's quiet mode (no dialog window will be shown)

chg: the client executable will now write to q3config.cfg on exit

chg: even lower CPU usage when minimized

chg: during id downloads (cl_allowDownload -1), the time-out is 5 seconds instead of cl_timeout

chg: the "nextdemo" cvar is now also used when playback stops before reaching the demo's end

chg: mouse motion is no longer forwarded to the mod when the console is down

chg: with 2+ monitors, having the console down will always disable input grabbing

chg: on Windows, a fatal error will move the early console window to the foreground

chg: com_hunkMegs doesn't have a maximum value anymore
  a value too high would reset it and the engine might fail to load with the default value

fix: broken pk3 files could cause crashes (entry names too long) and mess up the FS

fix: using /demo when running a listen server would load the map and then abort playback

fix: no longer making local copies of all the system info cvars of the current server
  this avoids undesired local changes to cvars such as sv_pure

fix: now updating the FS (connected to pure server, pak references) on client disconnects

fix: the condump command was truncating its file path argument to 64 characters

fix: "timedemo" playback runs at full speed again

fix: on Windows, when unfocused, the client would always sleep 5+ ms regardless of com_maxFPS

fix: conditional FS restarts will always re-order the pak list when connected to a pure server

fix: lifted the directory scanning restriction that affected pure listen servers

fix: getting stuck on "Awaiting snapshot..." when the server shuts down during client connection

fix: demo playback would crash when delta entities/players had an invalid field count

fix: strcpy calls with overlapping buffers (undefined behavior), which were responsible for the
  "chars.h not found" / "couldn't load any skills" issue preventing bots from being added

fix: on Linux, the 'Z' and '9' keys could not be bound

fix: cl_allowDownload 1 failing on "connect" (error 10047 on Windows)

fix: cl_allowDownload 1 was using the current directory instead of fs_basepath

fix: jitter due to snapshots piling up with the same server timestamp for loopback and LAN clients

fix: the Windows crash handler would incorrectly consider certain exceptions as fatal

  searchhelp <pattern>  to list all cvars and commands whose help or name matches the pattern

add: new CNQ3 download system that uses checksums to get the right pak files
  the CNQ3 download system will use the WorldSpawn map server for inexact queries
  (when loading demos or using /dlmap) when the CNQ3 map server doesn't have the file

  system | speed | cases               | source(s)     | file availability | server requirements
  -------|-------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------
  CNQ3   | fast  | pure servers, demos | map server(s) | not guaranteed    | none

add: m_accelOffset <0.001 to 5000> (default: 5) to control the power offset with m_accelStyle 1

add: sv_minRestartDelay <2 to 48> (default: 2)
	the min. amount of hours to wait for before restarting the server
	a scheduled restart won't happen until there are no more human players connected

add: con_scaleMode <0|1|2> (default: 0) specifies the console text scaling mode
  con_scaleMode 0 = text size scales with con_scale but not the resolution
  con_scaleMode 1 = text size scales with con_scale and the resolution
  con_scaleMode 2 = text size is always 8x12

add: command history saving with con_history (default: 1)

     r_mapBrightness <0.25 to 32.0> (default: 2) replaces r_mapOverBrightBits
  the new cvars use floating-point values (more control) and a linear scale (more intuitive)
  to convert the old engine values to the new values:
  r_brightness    = pow(2, r_overBrightBits)
  r_mapBrightness = pow(2, max(r_mapOverBrightBits - r_overBrightBits, 0))

chg: r_mode <0|1|2> (default: 0) selects the video mode
  r_mode 0 = no screen mode change, desktop resolution
  r_mode 1 = no screen mode change, custom resolution, custom upscale mode

  cl_allowDownload -1 = id's original download system
  cl_allowDownload  0 = downloads disabled
  cl_allowDownload  1 = CNQ3 download system

chg: cvars and commands are alphabetically sorted

chg: removed r_stencilbits, r_depthbits, r_colorbits, r_texturebits and r_ext_compressed_textures

chg: using stb_image to load png and tga images

chg: replaced monitor gamma by a post-process gamma shader and removed r_ignorehwgamma

chg: removed stereo rendering

chg: anti-aliasing sample count is set with r_msaa on all platforms (on Windows, it was r_ext_multisample)

chg: file system start-up will now verify the presence and integrity of baseq3/pak0-8.pk3 instead of only pak0

chg: replaced id's Huffman codec code with something both simpler and much faster

chg: tweaked console scrolling speeds, fixed backtip insertion on Windows

chg: improved level load times

chg: sound fall-off is linear instead of using a power function

chg: switch from libjpeg 6 to libjpeg-turbo

chg: removed the byzantine r_mode usage added in 1.47

fix: console/messagemode input buffers would ignore the last off-screen color modifier when scrolled

fix: console/messagemode input buffers would sometimes display the cursor at the wrong position

fix: taking screenshots with a render width (r_width) that wasn't a multiple of 4
  would either crash or produce bad screenshots

fix: false positives of the "SCR_UpdateScreen: recursively called" fatal error
  repro: connect, get kicked, connect, get kicked

fix: crash when the number of shader stages was wrong (would happen with the "brandon" player model)

fix: the release of a key bound to "+vstr a b" would execute "b" even though the key press didn't execute "a"

fix: /bind was treating single-character key names in a case sensitive manner

fix: r_fullbright is no longer latched and actually does its job

fix: r_lightmap is now archived and actually does its job

fix: commands registered by cgame no longer auto-complete after the cgame qvm has shut down

fix: libjpeg errors no longer shut down the engine

fix: broken rendering when the 2nd stage of a collapsed shader stage pair had non-white colors

fix: shader stages using "wave" were not animated when the server time was too large

fix: the pukka3tourney2 slime wasn't green with r_vertexLight 1

fix: the ct3ctf1 grate near quad was getting picmipped when it wasn't supposed to be

fix: improved the player name look-up behavior for these commands: kick, banUser, dumpuser
  if 2 players had the same name, it would just pick the first one (lowest client number)

fix: multi-view mouse input sensitivity is now the same as in the UI for compatible mods like CPMA 1.50

fix: fixed the start-up console window staying visible when starting in full-screen


Windows:

add: in_minimize registers a hotkey to minimize/restore the client
  key names must be separated by white space and there can be at most 2 modifier keys
	
add: auto-completion and command history in the dedicated server console window

add: new bindable key: BACKSLASH (the key to the right of the left shift button)

chg: removed DirectInput mouse input mode

chg: updated mouse input for better grab (de-)activation and fixed window dragging not working

chg: reduced raw mouse input latency and added cl_drawMouseLag

fix: disabled DPI scaling on the client

fix: the crash handler will reset the system timer resolution

fix: if requesting a resolution too high for the display, the image would be offset vertically

fix: in raw mouse input mode, keeping any button pressed while focusing the window would keep
  the cursor visible even after releasing all buttons


Linux:

add: m_relative <0|1> (default: 1) enables SDL's relative mouse mode
  you might want to set it to 0 if you have a messed up input driver

add: in_focusDelay <0 to 100> (default: 5) is the time in ms keypresses are ignored after the window gets the focus

add: minimize command to minimize the client's window

add: automatic dedicated server process restarts for crashes and timed reboots (sv_minRebootDelayMins)
  this means 2 CNQ3 processes run per server: a parent (fixed pid) and a child (new pid after each restart)
  this behavior can be disabled by passing "nohardreboot" as a command-line argument
  the new command sv_restartProcess can be used to shut down the child process and start a new one

chg: the client requires SDL 2 - the following things are handled by it:
  window, GL context, video modes, audio, kb and mouse input, monitor list, clipboard

chg: tty input behavior matches in-game behavior when cgame is running and fixed the truncated tty input

fix: color codes (e.g. "^1") don't get printed to the terminal anymore

fix: tty handling of the leading "]" character

  adds support for bmodel entities (doors, plats, etc)

add: back directInput mouse (in_mouse 2)

add: back flare support

add: disable/enable windows keyboard shortcuts

add: cnq3 windows can minimize/restore

add: dynamic light by GLSL shaders

add: r_maplightBrightness (from 0 to 8) and r_maplightSaturation(0-4). to use this parameters set r_maplightColorMode 1.

add: r_maplightColorMode to configure lightmaps

add: r_mode can be set resolution and frequency display. For example, r_mode "640x480@100"

fix: in_mouse -1 kept relocating the system cursor even if not focused

fix: implement the sound change from 1.45 *correctly*  :P

fix: default build does not create option r_smp. To assemble the build 
      with the option r_smp need to use preprocessor USE_R_SMP

fix: small fixes to CVA rendering code

fix: fix opStack and rename targets for unix

fix: GTV/spectator can't change POV after map changed

fix: render shader time overflow (fix splashdamage bug).

chg: sensitivity renamed to m_speed

chg: rewrote pretty much all the mouse code

  this means only mouse1-mouse5 are supported on windows, sigh MS...

chg: updated freetype from 2.3.5 to 2.3.11


05 Nov 09 - 1.45
note: this release REQUIRES arb shader support
  if your card doesn't have it, use an older version

add: hw gamma should work on Vista

add: r_measureoverdraw is actually useful

add: r_speeds is far more useful now

chg: sound attenuation is biased
  i.e. distant sounds are much louder than in 1.43
  since it's still more correctly spatialised than pre-1.43, this is
  the best compromise i can come up with

chg: r_fullbright works in vertexlight mode (only)
  instead of lightmap only, where it just wasted bandwidth and vram

chg: r_customwidth, r_customheight renamed to r_width, r_height

chg: hardcoded r_mode garbage and modelist removed:
  r_mode 0 (default) = current desktop resolution, depth, hz, etc
  r_mode 1 = custom resolution etc
  note: r_mode 1 WILL NOT tolerate invalid r_displayRefresh values any more

chg: require opengl 1.4 or higher
  removed r_allowExtensions, r_primitives, r_ext_compiled_vertex_array,
  r_ext_multitexture, r_ext_texture_env_add

chg: removed a bunch of useless/obsolete cvars:
  r_logfile, r_showcluster, r_facePlaneCull, r_ignoreFastPath, r_drawSun,
  r_simpleMipMaps, r_offsetFactor, r_offsetUnits

chg: don't tablist cheatvar noise if cheats are off

chg: removed the last bits of legacy altivec cruft

chg: rewrote pretty much all the dlight stuff
  not only does it actually work reliably now
  but it's also massively improved in terms of quality

fix: ignorehwgamma 1 would fail to apply sw gamma to some images

fix: roqs failed to apply sw gamma

fix: sv_floodprotect could block all commands indefinitely


12 Aug 09 - 1.44 (server only)

fix: unbannable player exploit (stanway/auriemma)


08 Aug 08 - 1.43

fixed sfx0 using a real sound and thus "hiding" it

corrected sv_pure back to CVAR_ROM

added the correct "fastsky!=0 == disable portals" test, ffs me  :P

removed long-obsoleted r_lastValidRenderer

removed long-obsoleted r_ext_gamma_control

removed pointless cl_forceavidemo

removed r_rail* and marked the never-used RT_BEAM etc as such

removed RAVENMD4 completely

r_fullbright is not a cheat var

fixed a bug with CVAR_CHEAT

fixed another bug in \video (hopefully)

fixed distance culling on dlit patch seams

changed r_ext_max_anisotropy default to 16

added con_scale for console font scaling
0 = Q3 style, always 8x12 pixels regardless of screen rez
1 = Q4 style, scales with screen rez
!0 = scale with screen rez and a custom multiplier

straightened out the con cvar mess:
cl_noprint -> con_noprint
scr_conspeed -> con_speed and correctly CVAR_ARCHIVE
con_notifytime correctly CVAR_ARCHIVE
removed cl_conXOffset since it basically doesn't work

sleep correctly if an unfocused client (win32-only)
don't sleep INcorrectly if a dedicated server (win32-only)

fixed a (huge) memory leak in the vm

fixed sv_pure 1 problems on listen servers

another overhaul of the sound code:

spatialisation is now correct, which has two huge impacts:
  you can "place" sounds MUCH more accurately than before,
  but as a result, distant sounds are MUCH quieter

removed s_doppler, it's almost right but it just sounds like shit

most of the s_mixprestep hackery has been removed, and you can
probably set it to 0 if your sound drivers work properly

OAL support has been dropped completely and indefinitely
  it's crap and i'm tired of it poisoning the codebase


Mar 08 - 1.42

bots are no longer kicked by devmap

legacy cack like joystick/midi support only pollutes configs if enabled

fixed a memory leak in the sound code

fixed even more (hopefully all) dropped sound issues in snd_dma

made com_soundmegs SLIGHTLY less broken: now only 2x instead of 3x  :P
note that "soundmegs" are taken FROM THE HUNK now to fix the leak
so you need to increase com_hunkmegs by 2x your com_soundmegs

removed the explicit and incorrect "fastsky==1 == disable portals" test

r_noportals is not a cheat var

hyperspace is a bit less annoying

purged the unused (never finished) idMD4 model code

fixed some bugs in referencedpak list generation

fixed roqs ignoring s_volume

fixed widescreen modes crashing on listen servers

fixed downloads not completing properly


18 Feb 08 - 1.41

removed all bs references to GT_SINGLE_PLAYER and ui_singlePlayerActive
(except from the bot code, which has bigger problems)
added sv_singleplayer

improved TTF overhead a lot: now as fast as crappy bitmap fonts  :D

removed the stupidity of every key aborting demo playback: now ESC only

only play the id logo cin the FIRST time, not every fkn time

removed the broken stencil/projection shadow code

avis produced by \video actually work (bug+fix both from ioq3)

fixed some ABSURD buffer overruns and broken code in snd_dma
which caused random dropped sounds for no reason
it's a miracle it doesn't segfault any real OS
also dumped the unused-since-TA adpcm/mulaw/etc cruft

fixed a TA-era (surprise, surprise) bug that broke loopsound behavior

loop (ie ambient) sounds are now 75% volume

q3config is NEVER autowritten just because of bind/cvar changes
it sucks if you're playing and it sucks even more if you're on GTV
UI/SP code should write it EXPLICITLY if they want to save something


19 Dec 07 - 1.40

the code now requires a C++ compiler
MASSIVE cleanups of the codebase, tho still plenty of bits left

screenshot filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS-TTT
this means they'll never collide *; moviemakers won't run out;
and the engine DOESN'T STAT 10,000 FILES EVERY FRAME
(* except at 2am on an autumn night if you're amazingly unlucky :P)

demo filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS

fixed demos to be MAX_OSPATH instead of MAX_QPATH, ie 256 chars now

renamed cl_mouseAccel to m_accel

removed ioq3 "qkey" rubbish

removed support for BMP and PCX

removed fs_cdpath, fs_copyfiles, touchfile, fs_restrict

removed support for IPX

removed in_logitechbug

updated cpu detection

added TTF support

fixed a bunch of stuff in ScanAndLoadShaderFiles, but it's still crap

fixed the patch collision epsilon bugs of 1.34

reverted to id's tab-completion since ioq3's is so hated
i've semi-merged them atm, will fix up when i get time

interpreted vm is never used on platforms that support compiled vm

clampmaps and nomip images use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE rather than GL_CLAMP

disabled curl until it's brought up to standard
